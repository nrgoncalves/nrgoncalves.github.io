David Marr was a bright computer scientist whose work still has a remarkable impact in modern computational neuroscience. He published several papers on stereoscopic vision, of which the most popular I explore here.

Take a look at the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/nrgoncalves/notebooks/blob/master/marr-poggio-76.ipynb).
