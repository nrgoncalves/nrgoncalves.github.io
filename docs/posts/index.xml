      <title>Spark Standalone Cluster</title>

      <description>This is a quick note on how to set up a Spark cluster in standalone mode. This is useful if you want to setup a cluster for your own development purposes or if you just want to do it for fun—for more serious use cases, Spark clusters should be setup on top of YARN or Kubernetes.
You will need to create a few VMs: one VM for the cluster manager and then one or more VMs where the executors will be running.</description>

      <title>Puppet with a Agent-Master architecture</title>

      <description>There are many resources out there which—rightly—focus on teaching Puppet using simple architectures, e.g. a single node, masterless setup. However, I found less info on how to set up Puppet with an Agent-Master architecture.
This short article gives a very high-level overview of the main steps. It is not a self-sufficient tutorial by any means—but I am hoping it will still be useful for those trying to understand the big picture.</description>

      <title>Privacy-compatible automated contact tracing</title>

      <description>If you are following the news, you may have heard about Contact Tracing and how it can help us contain communicable diseases such as COVID-19. Essentially, contact tracing is the process of manually identifying and closely monitoring those in close contact with people that have been diagnosed with an infectious disease. It is commonly performed for diseases such as tuberculosis and measles and it can help by:
Breaking transmission chains Notifying contacts of a potential infection Enabling early testing and treatment of vulnerable contacts However, the large volumes of COVID-19 cases and the speed at which the disease spreads make it difficult to perform accurate and timely contact tracing manually.</description>

      <title>A normalization model of multisensory integration</title>

      <description>Many neurons in the brain are driven by more than one sensory system (e.g. vision and audition), and they might play an important role in improving our perception of what surrounds us. Here I explore recent work by Ohshiro and colleages on the role of divisive normalization in multisensory integration.

      <description>David Marr was a bright computer scientist whose work still has a remarkable impact in modern computational neuroscience. He published several papers on stereoscopic vision, of which the most popular I explore here.

      <description>Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since Ohzawa and colleagues proposed a model of how cortical neurons in primary visual cortex might support depth discrimination. Here is a demo of how it works, written in Julia.
