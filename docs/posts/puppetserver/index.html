However, I found less info on how to set up Puppet with an Agent-Master architecture.\nThis short article gives a very high-level overview of the main steps. It is not a self-sufficient tutorial by any means—but I am hoping it will still be useful for those trying to understand the big picture.\nBriefly, we need multiple VMs. One VM will act as the master VM and will hold the Puppet manifests. Other VMs will be nodes—they will be running the Puppet Agent periodically to get the desired configuration from the master and execute the required tasks to make the node’s state aligned with what is defined in the Puppet manifests.\nPuppet master We first need to create a virtual machine to act as our puppet master. Here we’re using a VM running CentOS 7. Let’s assume its FQDN is puppet.myproject.example.com.\nsudo su - rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm yum install puppetserver systemctl enable --now puppetserver The puppetserver service should now be running on your puppet master VM. To verify that the puppetserver CLI has been installed correctly, run\npuppetserver -v on a new shell. If this does not work, it is probably because puppetserver has not been added to your PATH, so you’ll need to investigate why that was the case.\nYou should also test that the puppet agent can run on the master:\nsudo su - puppet agent --test --server {FQDN} If the above agent run completed successfully, we are pretty much done with the initial master configuration.\nPuppet agent on a node VM Now we need to create at least one node VM to test if things really are working. Let’s assume the VM is running CentOS 7 and that the FQDN is node01.myproject.example.com.\nLet’s start by installing the agent and enabling it as a service\nsudo yum install puppet-agent sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true Now we need to add puppet to our PATH and configure the server\nsource /etc/profile.d/puppet-agent.sh puppet config set server puppet.myproject.example.com --section main No we need to get the node talking to the master. To do that, we first run\npuppet ssl bootstrap on the node VM. This should have requested a certificate signature to the master VM, which we now need to sign. SSH into the master VM, change to root and run\npuppetserver ca sign --certname node01.myproject.example.com This should have successfully signed the certificate for the node VM, which means that the puppet master and the node VM should now be able to work together.\nWe need to repeat this section for every node you want to manage with puppet, e.g. node02.myproject.puppet.com, node03.myproject.puppet.com and so on.\nAt a high-level, this is pretty much it. The next step is to actually start writing some puppet manifests.\nWriting Puppet manifests Puppet’s installation process should have created a set of files and folders on the master VM. They are located under /etc/puppetlabs/code/. This is where Puppet expects to find manifests. A standard production environment is created by default, with a standard structure for organising Puppet manifests. These can be found under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production.\nIt is a good idea to track changes in these files using a version control tool like git, and pull those changes onto the master VM once you are ready to test or apply them.\nI am going to start by creating a simple file resource just for testing purposes and I will apply it to all nodes. I create a manifests/site.pp file with the following contents\nnode default { file {'/tmp/test.txt': content =\u003e 'test file content', } } This asks Puppet to create a file /tmp/test.txt with the content test file content for all nodes.\nTo test that this is working, ssh into the node VM and run:\npuppet agent --test The agent will then retrieve the desired system state from the master, and execute the corresponding tasks to achieve such state. If all worked well, the file /tmp/test.txt should now exist on the node VM.\nThis is an embarrassingly simple example of what we can do with Puppet—for a proper treatment of Puppet’s features, take a look at Puppet’s documentation.\nConclusion The aim of this short article was to provide a very high-level overview of how the basic steps that are required to set up Puppet with an Agent-Master architecture.\nI have skipped over lots of details (e.g. networking), but the goal here is to focus on the “big picture” rather than setup details, which will differ significantly depending on the OS platform or cloud provider of choice.\n",
